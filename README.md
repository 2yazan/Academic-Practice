# Academic Practice

## Description
This repository contains the work I completed during the **Academic Practice** subject in the second semester of university. The practice lasted for 15 days and included 10 tasks completed in C language and 5 tasks completed in Excel. The goal of this practice was to develop practical programming and problem-solving skills by applying basic concepts in software engineering.

## Practices 1 to 10 (C Language)

### Practice 1: Angle Conversion
**Task**: Convert the angle given in radians to degrees, minutes, and seconds.

### Practice 2: Triangle Type
**Task**: Determine whether a triangle with sides `a`, `b`, and `c` is obtuse, right, or acute.

### Practice 3: Epsilon Condition
**Task**: Find the smallest integer `n` such that `(2^n) / (n!) < ε`. Display all terms of the sequence up to the `n-th` term.

### Practice 4: Array to Matrix
**Task**: Rearrange a one-dimensional array with `n * n` elements into a `n x n` matrix, row by row.

### Practice 5: Spiral Matrix
**Task**: Fill an `m x n` matrix with natural numbers from 1 to `m * n` in a spiral pattern, starting from the top-left corner.

### Practice 6: Saddle Points
**Task**: Find all saddle points in a matrix, which are elements that are both the largest in their column and the smallest in their row, or determine if none exist.

### Practice 7: Divisibility by 9
**Task**: For natural numbers not exceeding `k`, check the divisibility rule for 9. Output the last `m` such numbers.

### Practice 8: Convex Hull
**Task**: Find the convex hull of a given set of points on a plane.

### Practice 9: Transposing a Matrix
**Task**: Transpose a rectangular matrix without allocating an additional array to store the result. Represent the matrix as a one-dimensional array.

### Practice 10: Longest Word and Sentence
**Task**: Find the longest word and the longest sentence in a given text.

## Practices 11 to 15 (Excel Tasks)

### Practice 11: Bisector of Cartesian Angles
**Task**: Construct the bisector of the I—III coordinate angles of the Cartesian coordinate system in the range `x ∈ [-3;3]` with a step of `∆ = 0.5`.

### Practice 12: Hyperbola Plot
**Task**: Plot a hyperbola for the range `0.1 ≤ x ≤ 5.1` with a step of `∆ = 0.25`. The equation is `y = (1/2) * x`.

### Practice 13: System of Equations
**Task**: Solve the system of equations `y = ln(x)` and `y = -2x + 1` for the interval `0.2 ≤ x ≤ 2.5` with a step of `Δ = 0.2`.

### Practice 14: Plane Intersections
**Task**: Construct a plane that intersects segments on the coordinate axes at `a = 3`, `b = 2`, and `c = 1` in the range `-1 ≤ x ≤ 4` with a step of `Δ = 5`, and `-1 ≤ y ≤ 3` with a step of `Δ = 1`.

### Practice 15: Upper Part of Hyperboloid
**Task**: Construct the upper part of the hyperboloid given by the equation `x^2/9 + y^2/4 - z^2 = -1` within the range `-3 ≤ x ≤ 3`, `-2 ≤ y ≤ 2`.
